Before creating your first  CodeIgniter project, make sure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. 
If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed in minutes via  CodeIgniter Herd. 
In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.


After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new  CodeIgniter project via Composer's create-project command:

composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter example-app


Once the project has been created, start  CodeIgniter's local development server using  CodeIgniter Artisan's serve command:

cd example-app
 
php spark serve


Once you have started the Spark development server, 
your application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8080. 

Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the CodeIgniter ecosystem. 
Of course, you may also want to configure a database.
