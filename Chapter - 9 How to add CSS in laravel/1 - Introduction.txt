Adding CSS (Stylesheets):

To change the instructions from Laravel to CodeIgniter 4, follow these steps:

1. **Create a CSS file:**
   - Place your CSS files in the `public/css` directory of your CodeIgniter 4 project. For example, you can create a file named `styles.css` in `public/css`.

2. **Link the CSS file in your CodeIgniter views:**
   - Open the view file where you want to include the CSS file (e.g., `app/Views/welcome.php`) and add the following line in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= base_url('css/main.css'); ?>">
```

### Note:
- The `public` directory in CodeIgniter 4 is the root directory for all publicly accessible files, similar to Laravel.
- The `base_url()` function in CodeIgniter 4 generates the base URL of your application, and it will properly link to the `css/styles.css` file in the `public` directory.
- Ensure the `public/css/main.css` file has the correct permissions so that it is accessible to the public.

With these adjustments, the styles will be correctly included in your CodeIgniter 4 views.
